# SupportingLongTermCancerCondition
# An app for my FYP.
To use this app, you must have a Firebase and Spoonacular account.

Firebase was used to support user authorization, a simple chat room, and user data storage such as BMR, caloric consumption, etc.
Spoonacular API supports easy access to healthy meal recipes, thanks to which the patient can better reduce excess caloric intake.

Please excuse some of the code quality. The project was based on the apps' functionality and my research, so code quality sometimes lapsed in a rush to complete the project ;)
